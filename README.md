cd Pothole_detection-System
```

### `npm install`

> **Note: Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine.** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

## Add TensorFlow.js Model to the App
There is already a model in the `public` folder of this repository, but if you have trained your own model then you can simply swap the existing model with the one you have

## Run the App
